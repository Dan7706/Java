Here are some common tasks and inteview questions inplementations in Java.

    compiling the code:
        javac your_file_name.java ##// this command will create  .class file with the name of your class. 
    

    running the code:
         java Main  ##// without the .class 
    
Here there is also a dynamic array implementation, but that is only for learning purposes, in 
prosuction please use ArrayList built-in class in Java that is much faster and more effective.

Feel free to use them and practice on your own.
